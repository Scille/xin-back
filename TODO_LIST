core

	- Remove reference to the policies link to xin in history_api.
	  Pass the policiy through the context or creation of the object?
	  To check with Manu

	- Do we need a definition of the connector, since a connector is simply
	  a translation method between two system? Maybe a factorization is possible
	  and an abstraction (composition no extending)
	  Produce client code something like this
	  TestingConnector
	  	self.connector(core.connector.Connector)
	  	connector.translate ?? (to check)

  	- a broker definition same as the connector?? maybe it is needed to have
  	  some tools to help the developper to create a broker

Gros problemes d'interdependance dans les tests entre xin et core, aucune des fonctionalit√© du core n'as l'air d'etre unit tester
don't get what the file test_cors test

Reminder a test is a test if the name of it is comprehensible by another personn and his code also, if it's too complicate it is not a tester
